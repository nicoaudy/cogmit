# üöÄ Releasing cogmit

This document explains how to create releases for cogmit.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Git repository with GitHub remote
- GitHub Actions enabled for the repository
- Push access to the repository

## üè∑Ô∏è Creating a Release

### 1. Update Version

Update the version in your code if needed, then commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: prepare for v1.0.0 release"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Create and Push Tag

Use the Makefile to create a release:

```bash
# Create release v1.0.0
make release VERSION=1.0.0

# Or manually:
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### 3. GitHub Actions

Once you push the tag, GitHub Actions will automatically:

1. ‚úÖ Run tests
2. üî® Build binaries for all platforms:
   - `cogmit-linux-amd64`
   - `cogmit-linux-arm64`
   - `cogmit-darwin-amd64`
   - `cogmit-darwin-arm64`
   - `cogmit-windows-amd64.exe`
   - `cogmit-windows-arm64.exe`
3. üì¶ Create a GitHub release with all binaries
4. üîê Generate checksums for verification

### 4. Verify Release

Check the [Releases page](https://github.com/nicoaudy/cogmit/releases) to see your new release with all the compiled binaries.

## üéØ Supported Platforms

- **Linux**: amd64, arm64
- **macOS**: amd64, arm64 (Apple Silicon)
- **Windows**: amd64, arm64

## üìù Release Notes

GitHub Actions will automatically generate release notes based on your commits since the last release. You can edit these in the GitHub UI after the release is created.

## üîß Manual Release (if needed)

If you need to create a release manually:

```bash
# Build all platforms
make build-all

# Create checksums
cd build
sha256sum * > checksums.txt

# Upload to GitHub releases manually
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Release not created?**
- Check GitHub Actions tab for any failed workflows
- Ensure the tag was pushed: `git ls-remote --tags origin`
- Verify GitHub Actions is enabled in repository settings

**Missing binaries?**
- Check the Actions log for build errors
- Ensure all platforms built successfully
- Verify the workflow file is in `.github/workflows/`

**Version not showing correctly?**
- Check that the version is set correctly in the tag
- Verify the LDFLAGS in the Makefile
- Test locally with `make build && ./build/cogmit --version`
